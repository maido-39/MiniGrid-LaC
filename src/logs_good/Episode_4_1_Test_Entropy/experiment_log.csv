2. Task Completion Check: The current goal is to go to the preparation room (F6-H8). The robot is currently at L6, which is outside the preparation room. Therefore, the subtask is not yet completed.
3. Action Feasibility: The robot is at L6. Possible moves are north (L7), south (L5), west (K6), east (M6 - out of bounds). Moving west to K6 is a valid move into an empty cell. Moving north or south would place the robot on cells containing objects (tomato at L7, red pepper at L5). While the rules don't explicitly forbid moving onto objects unless required to avoid them, moving west to an empty cell is a safer and more direct path to the goal.
4. Loop Prevention: The previous action was 'move down'. Moving 'west' does not reverse the previous move and is not a repeat of a failed action.
5. Grounding Rule: No specific grounding rules apply to this situation.

Decision: The preparation room is the yellow-green block from F6 to H8. The robot is at L6. The Manhattan distance to the closest part of the preparation room (H6) from L6 is 4.

2. Task completion check: The current subtask is to 'Go to the kitchen (A6-C8)'. The robot is at E5, which is outside the kitchen area (A6-C8). Therefore, the subtask is not completed.
3. Action feasibility: 
   - Moving 'north' to E6 (5,6) is valid as E6 is an empty cell.
   - Moving 'south' to E4 (5,4) is invalid as E4 contains a purple block (obstacle).
   - Moving 'west' to D5 (4,5) is valid as D5 is an empty cell.

5. Grounding rule: No specific grounding rule applies to this situation.

Selecting actions: The goal is to reach the kitchen (A6-C8). The robot is at E5 (5,5). The closest point in the kitchen is, for example, C6 (3,6). 
- Moving 'north' to E6 (5,6) reduces the Manhattan distance to C6 from 3 to 2. It also brings the robot into the target row (row 6).
- Moving 'west' to D5 (4,5) also reduces the Manhattan distance to C6 from 3 to 2. It brings the robot closer to the target column (column C).
Both 'north' and 'west' are optimal choices for reducing the Manhattan distance. 'North' is chosen as the primary action to prioritize reaching the target row. 'West' is a secondary optimal choice.
