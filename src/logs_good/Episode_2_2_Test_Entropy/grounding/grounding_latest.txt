## Final Grounding (Generated by VLM)

### Spatial Grounding
The environment contains several distinct areas: a purple restroom where hands can be washed, a red storage room where ingredients like red pepper and red tomato can be found in adjacent tiles, a preparation room, a kitchen, a plating room, and a dining room. It is critical to avoid colliding with walls as this is a dangerous and wrong action.
