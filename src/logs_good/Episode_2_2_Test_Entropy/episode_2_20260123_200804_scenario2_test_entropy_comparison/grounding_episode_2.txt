## Final Grounding (Generated by VLM)

### Spatial Grounding
The environment contains distinct functional areas: a restroom for washing hands, a storage room where ingredients like red pepper and red tomato are located (a tomato is specifically at L7), a preparation room for preparing food, a kitchen for cooking meals, a plating room for plating the prepared meals, and a dining room for serving. When navigating to the tomato at L7, the correct direction is upwards.
