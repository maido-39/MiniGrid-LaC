2. Task completion check: The current mission is to 'Go to the preparation room (F6-H8)'. The robot is currently at K7, which is not within the coordinates F6-H8. Therefore, the subtask is not yet completed.
3. Action feasibility: 
    - Moving 'west' from K7 to J7 is feasible as J7 is an empty cell. 
    - Moving 'north' from K7 to K8 is feasible as K8 is an empty cell. 
    - Moving 'south' from K7 to K6 is not feasible as K6 is occupied by the red counter/table, which acts as an obstacle.
    - Moving 'east' from K7 to L7 is feasible as L7 is an empty cell.
4. Loop prevention: The previous action was 'move left' (from L7 to K7). Moving 'west' (left) again from K7 to J7 does not constitute an immediate reversal of the previous move, nor is it repeating a failed action. Thus, no loop prevention rules are violated.
5. Grounding rule: No specific grounding rules apply to this situation.

Based on heuristics, the goal is to reach any cell within F6-H8. The closest point is H7. The Manhattan distance from K7 to H7 is 3. 
- Moving 'west' to J7 reduces the Manhattan distance to H7 to 2. This is a strictly distance-reducing action.
- Moving 'north' to K8 increases the Manhattan distance to H7 to 4.
- Moving 'east' to L7 increases the Manhattan distance to H7 to 4.

You are a robot operating in a grid-based environment.
You must carry out this mission successfully.


## Mission
Your mission is:
Go to the dining room and serve, the dining room is L12


## Decision Rules
Based on the current image, choose the next action to complete this mission.
Use absolute directions (up/down/left/right).

You can divide this mission into subtasks.
