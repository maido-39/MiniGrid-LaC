    "trajectory_summary": "The episode successfully completed a multi-stage culinary mission, starting with hygiene and progressing through ingredient fetching, preparation, cooking, plating, and serving. The robot first navigated to the restroom to wash its hands (Step 3). Subsequently, it proceeded to the storage area (Step 12) to collect ingredients, specifically identifying and picking up pepper at L5 (Step 15) and tomato at L7 (Step 17). After gathering ingredients, the robot moved to the preparation room (Step 21), then to the kitchen for cooking (Step 26), followed by the plating room (Step 30), and finally to the dining room to serve the meal (Step 40). All sub-missions were completed successfully, leading to the overall mission accomplishment.",
    "error_diagnosis": "No explicit errors, failures, or suboptimal decisions were identified in this episode. All steps, from navigating to various functional areas (restroom, storage, preparation, kitchen, plating, dining) to identifying and picking up specific ingredients (pepper, tomato), were executed successfully as indicated by the 'SUCCESS' feedback for each step. The robot demonstrated effective use of spatial information to locate target areas and objects. The grounding knowledge confirms successful navigation to specific locations and objects, such as the tomato at L7, without any noted issues in direction or pathfinding.",
    "correction_plan": "Given the successful completion of all mission objectives without any identified errors or suboptimal decisions, the primary correction plan is to reinforce the current successful strategy. The robot effectively utilized the provided spatial coordinates for rooms and specific object locations, along with object descriptions (e.g., 'red, curved shape' for pepper, 'red, round shape' for tomato). \n\n1.  **Reinforce Spatial Grounding**: Continue to leverage precise spatial coordinates for rooms and objects. The ability to navigate directly to 'L7' for the tomato and specific square ranges for rooms was highly effective. \n2.  **Maintain Procedural Adherence**: The sequential execution of tasks (wash hands -> fetch ingredients -> prepare -> cook -> plate -> serve) was logical and efficient. This procedural understanding should be maintained for similar multi-stage missions.\n3.  **Enhance Object Recognition/Localization**: The successful identification and pickup of specific items based on location and description (pepper at L5, tomato at L7) indicates robust object handling. Future tasks should continue to provide such detailed grounding information to ensure accuracy."
