  "reflexion": {
    "trajectory_summary": "The episode involved a sequence of tasks related to preparing and serving food. The robot successfully navigated to the restroom (Step 3), then to the storage room (Step 12). During ingredient collection, the robot faced difficulties. It initially moved away from the pepper (Step 15) and collided with a wall (Step 17) before successfully locating it (Step 18). Similarly, for the tomato, the robot took a significantly non-optimal and circuitous path, repeatedly moving in incorrect directions and away from the target (Steps 19-31) before finally reaching it (Step 36). Subsequent navigations to the Preparation room (Step 40), Kitchen (Step 45), and Plating room (Step 49) were successful. The final task of going to the Dining room also saw a wall collision (Step 59) before successful completion (Step 60). The overall mission was completed, but with notable inefficiencies and navigation errors.",
    "error_diagnosis": "The primary errors observed throughout the episode relate to inefficient navigation, incorrect spatial reasoning, and constraint violations:\n\n1.  **Inefficient Object Retrieval (Steps 15, 19-31):**\n    *   **Moving away from target:** At Step 15, the robot moved away from the pepper, directly contradicting the goal of getting closer. This pattern repeated for the tomato (Steps 19, 20, 22, 23, 24, 28, 29, 31), where the robot consistently chose paths that increased distance to the target or were explicitly noted as 'wrong direction' or 'not optimal'. This indicates a failure to correctly interpret spatial relationships or prioritize movements that reduce distance to a known target coordinate (L5 for pepper, L7 for tomato).\n    *   **Lack of optimal path following:** The `procedural_grounding` explicitly states to 'Always aim to follow the optimal path'. The repeated feedback about 'not optimal path' (e.g., Step 20) and 'wrong direction' (e.g., Step 22, 23, 24, 28, 29) for the tomato retrieval highlights a significant deviation from this rule.\n\n2.  **Constraint Violations - Wall Collisions (Steps 17, 59):**\n    *   The robot collided with a wall while attempting to find pepper (Step 17) and again when navigating to the dining room (Step 59). This directly violates the critical constraint: 'Do not enter in collision with brick walls'. These collisions indicate a failure in obstacle avoidance and path planning, especially given that the constraint is clearly stated.",
    "correction_plan": "To improve future performance, the following actions are recommended:\n\n1.  **Enhance Spatial Reasoning and Path Planning for Object Retrieval:**\n    *   **Prioritize distance reduction:** When a target object's precise location (e.g., L5, L7) is provided in the mission, the robot must prioritize movements that directly reduce the Euclidean distance to that coordinate. Implement a mechanism to calculate the relative direction (e.g., North-East for L7 from current position) and favor actions that align with this direction, as suggested by `spatial_grounding` feedback (e.g., 'go up and right' at Step 23, 28, 29).\n    *   **Incorporate coordinate-based navigation:** For missions where specific cell coordinates are given, the robot should leverage this information to generate a direct path, rather than relying solely on visual cues or trial-and-error, which led to many suboptimal steps for the tomato.\n\n2.  **Strengthen Collision Avoidance Mechanisms:**\n    *   **Pre-emptive obstacle detection:** Before executing a move, the robot should check if the intended next cell is occupied by a 'brick wall' or any other forbidden obstacle. If a collision is imminent, the robot should re-evaluate its action to choose an alternative, safe movement, as per the 'Do not enter in collision with brick walls' constraint. This is crucial for preventing errors like those at Step 17 and Step 59.\n    *   **Penalty for constraint violation:** Reinforce a strong negative feedback or penalty for wall collisions to discourage such actions and encourage learning safer navigation strategies.\n\n3.  **Reinforce Optimal Path Following:**\n    *   **Path efficiency evaluation:** Implement a system to evaluate the efficiency of chosen paths, especially for multi-step navigation. The `procedural_grounding` emphasizes 'optimal path', so the robot should be trained to identify and prefer shorter, more direct routes, minimizing redundant movements or detours like those seen during tomato retrieval (Steps 19-31)."
