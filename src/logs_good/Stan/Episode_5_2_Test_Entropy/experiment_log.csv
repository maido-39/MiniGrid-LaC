2. Task completion check: The current subtask is to reach a cell adjacent to the ingredients. The robot is at H4, which is not adjacent to any ingredients (J7, K7, L7, J5, K5, L5). Therefore, the subtask is still 'in_progress'.
3. Action feasibility: From H4:
   - 'north' to H5: H5 is empty. Valid.
   - 'south' to H3: H3 is empty. Valid.
   - 'west' to G4: G4 is empty. Valid.
   - 'east' to I4: I4 is empty. Valid.
4. Loop prevention: The previous action was 'move up' (north). Moving 'south' would be the direct inverse. While allowed under certain conditions, there are other valid and goal-directed moves, so it's not the primary choice. No oscillatory behavior is detected.
5. Goal-directed filtering and preference resolution: The mission is to 'Get the ingredients'. The ingredients are located in columns J, K, L and rows 5, 7. The robot is at H4. The most direct path to get adjacent to the ingredients is to move towards columns J, K, L. 
   - Moving 'east' to I4 reduces the Manhattan distance to potential goal cells like J4 (distance reduces from 2 to 1) and I5 (distance reduces from 2 to 1). I4 is also a good staging point to reach all ingredient locations.
   - Moving 'north' to H5 reduces the Manhattan distance to I5 (from 2 to 1) but increases distance to J4 (from 2 to 3).
   - Moving 'south' to H3 or 'west' to G4 would increase the distance to all ingredient locations.
   Therefore, 'east' is the most optimal action as it brings the robot closer to the general area of the ingredients.","None","Robot at H4.

6. Decision: The goal is to reach a cell adjacent to the ingredients. The closest ingredients are at (J,5), (K,5), (L,5).
