2. Task completion check: The mission is to find the tomato at L7. The robot is currently at K6, not L7. Therefore, the subtask is not completed.
3. Action feasibility: From K6, all adjacent cells (K7, K5, J6, L6) are empty and do not contain walls or obstacles. Thus, 'north', 'south', 'west', and 'east' are all feasible moves.
4. Loop prevention: The previous action was 'move right' (east). Moving 'west' would immediately reverse this move. While not strictly forbidden if no other options exist, it's not preferred. Both 'east' and 'north' are better options as they reduce the distance to the goal.
5. Grounding rule: No specific grounding rules apply to this situation.

Decision: The goal is L7. From K6:
- Moving 'east' to L6 reduces the Manhattan distance to L7 (from 2 to 1).
- Moving 'north' to K7 also reduces the Manhattan distance to L7 (from 2 to 1).
Both 'east' and 'north' are optimal moves in terms of reducing distance. I will prioritize 'east' to move towards the target column first. 'North' is the next best option.
