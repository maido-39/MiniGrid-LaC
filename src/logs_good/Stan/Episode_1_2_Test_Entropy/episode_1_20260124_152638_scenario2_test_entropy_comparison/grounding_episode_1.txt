## Final Grounding (Generated by VLM)

### Spatial Grounding
The environment contains several distinct areas: a restroom, a storage room, a preparation room, a kitchen, a plating room, and a dining room. Food ingredients such as red pepper and tomato are found in the storage room. The red tomato is specifically located at cell L7. When navigating, always move closer to the target; moving away from the target or colliding with walls are critical failures and must be avoided. To reach the tomato, move in the up and right (north-east) directions.

### Procedural Grounding
Always aim to follow the optimal path to the target, even if a non-optimal path eventually leads to success.
