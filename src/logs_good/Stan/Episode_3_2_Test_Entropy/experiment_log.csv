2. Task completion check: The mission is to find the tomato at K7. The robot is currently at J5, not at the target location, so the subtask is not complete.
3. Action feasibility: 
   - Moving 'north' from J5 would lead to J6, which is blocked by a red bar obstacle. This action is invalid.
   - Moving 'south' from J5 to J4 is valid but increases the Manhattan distance to the target (K7).
   - Moving 'east' from J5 to K5 is valid. However, from K5, moving north to K6 is blocked by the red bar, effectively creating a dead end for reaching K7 from that side. 
   - Moving 'west' from J5 to I5 is valid. This opens up a path to go around the red bar obstacle (J6, K6) by moving north through I5, I6, I7, I8, then east to J8, K8, and finally south to K7. This path reduces the effective distance to the goal.
4. Loop prevention: The previous action was 'move left' (west), and it was successful. Repeating this action is not a loop and is not prevented by the rule.
