Therefore, 'east' is a valid action to consider. 2. Task completion check: The robot is currently at I4. The mission goal is to reach J6, K6, or L6. Since the robot is not in any of these target cells, the subtask 'Reach J6, K6, or L6 (storage area)' is still 'in_progress'. 3. Action feasibility: All proposed actions (east, north, south) lead to empty cells (J4, I5, I3 respectively) and do not encounter walls or restricted rooms. All are feasible. 4. Loop prevention: The last action 'move right' (east) was successful. Repeating 'east' is not a loop as the robot's position changed. 5. Grounding rule: No specific grounding rule applies to this situation. 6. Heuristics: The Manhattan distance from I4 to the closest target cell (J6) is 3. Moving 'east' to J4 reduces the distance to J6 to 2. Moving 'north' to I5 also reduces the distance to J6 to 2. Both 'east' and 'north' are optimal in terms of Manhattan distance reduction. Moving 'south' to I3 increases the distance to J6 to 4. Preferring to continue the successful previous direction ('east') when multiple optimal paths exist, 'east' is chosen as the primary action.
