## Constraints
- Do not enter in collision with brick walls. So if you are one cell next to a brick walls, don't face it and try to rotate towards more open view field.
- Do not pick up objects unless instructed to do so.","[""east"", ""south"", ""north""]","1. Last action result: 'move down' was successful, and the robot's position changed. 2. Task completion check: The current mission is 'Plate the food'. The first subtask is to reach a food item. The closest food item is an apple at J7. The agent is currently at I8. Moving 'east' to J8 will place the agent adjacent to the apple at J7, completing the 'go to food' subtask. 3. Action feasibility: Moving 'east' from I8 to J8 is possible as J8 is an empty cell and not a wall. 4. Loop prevention: 'east' is not a reversal of the previous action 'move down' (south), nor is it a repeated failed action. 5. Grounding rule: No specific grounding rules apply to this situation.","None","Agent at I8, closest food (apple) at J7.
