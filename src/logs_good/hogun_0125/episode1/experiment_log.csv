Loop prevention: The previous action was 'move right'. The proposed action 'north' is not the same as 'move right' and does not reverse the previous move, nor does it repeat a failed action. 5. Goal-directed filtering: The closest target cell is J6 (10,6). The robot is at I5 (9,5). The current Manhattan distance to J6 is |10-9| + |6-5| = 2. Moving 'north' to I6 (9,6) would result in a Manhattan distance of |10-9| + |6-6| = 1, which strictly reduces the distance. Moving 'south' or 'west' would increase the distance.

5. Grounding rule: No specific grounding rules apply to this situation.

## Decision Rules
Based on the current image, choose the next action to complete this mission.
Use absolute directions (up/down/left/right).

You can divide this mission into subtasks.
