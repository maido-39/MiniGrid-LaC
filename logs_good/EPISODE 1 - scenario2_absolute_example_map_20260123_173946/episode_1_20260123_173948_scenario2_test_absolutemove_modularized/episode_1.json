    "trajectory_summary": "The episode successfully completed a multi-stage food preparation mission. The robot began by performing a hygiene task, washing hands in the restroom (Step 3). It then proceeded to the storage room to gather ingredients (Step 12), successfully locating pepper (Step 15) and then tomato (Steps 16-23). After ingredient collection, the robot moved to the preparation room (Step 27), followed by the kitchen for cooking (Step 32), and finally the plating room to plate the dishes (Step 36), thereby completing all assigned tasks.",
    "error_diagnosis": "The primary error identified was a spatial navigation misjudgment during the task of finding the tomato at L7. In Step 16 and Step 17, despite the mission explicitly stating the tomato is at L7, the robot initially attempted to move 'down' instead of the correct direction 'up'. This indicates a failure in accurately translating the target coordinate (L7) relative to its current position into the precise absolute movement direction. The feedback for these steps explicitly points out this directional error ('you should have went up instead of down', 'you should go up'). Although the task was eventually completed (Step 23), this misdirection led to inefficient navigation. \n\nAdditionally, Step 17 presented a mission instruction in an unexpected language (Korean), which is a significant deviation from the expected format and language. While the system feedback still guided the robot towards the tomato, such an anomaly could lead to severe misinterpretations or failures in more complex scenarios.",

When a specific coordinate (e.g., L7) is provided, the robot must precisely calculate the relative movement (up/down/left/right) from its current position. This could involve: \n1.  Implementing a more robust coordinate-to-direction mapping logic. \n2.  Adding a validation step to confirm the chosen direction aligns with the target coordinate before execution. \n3.  Explicitly leveraging the provided spatial grounding knowledge, such as 'When navigating towards the tomato at L7, the correct direction is upwards', to override or confirm calculated directions.",
